--- @since 26.9.1
--- wayclip.yazi - move files between Yazi and the rest of your Wayland desktop.
---
--- Three entry points, selected by the first plugin argument:
---   copy   put the selection on the clipboard as a text/uri-list
---   cut    put the selection on the clipboard marked for moving
---   paste  read the clipboard and copy or move those files into the cwd
---
--- The URI encoding in `encode_uri` follows grappas/wl-clipboard.yazi (MIT).

--- Work out which files to publish, and whether Yazi considers them cut.
---
--- Yazi's own `yank` clears the visual selection as it fills the yank buffer,
--- so a binding chained as [ "yank --cut", "plugin wayclip" ] finds an empty
--- selection by the time the plugin runs. The yank buffer is therefore the
--- first place to look, and it carries `is_cut` with it.

---
--- GNOME writes "cut\nfile://..." or "copy\nfile://..." to its own type, and
